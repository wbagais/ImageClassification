This project is for GDIT Challenge (Option 2): Image Classification as part of PatriotHacks hackathon <br>
The challenge details available in https://github.com/vennergd/PatriotHack 


## image_classification.ipynb: 
this file contains the main code; the code divided into main two parts:
- <b>Predict image classification based on the pre-train model: </b> We used Vgg16 and VGG19, and based on the testing, Vgg16 is a better model.
- <b>Edit the pre-tarin model to predict images based on the nine classifications in the images folder: </b> Also, the Vgg16 perform better in the edited version.
